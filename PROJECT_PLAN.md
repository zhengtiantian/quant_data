# Quant Data Project Plan

## Goal
Build a research-ready, then production-ready, mid-frequency stock prediction system for holding periods of:

- 1 week
- 2-4 weeks
- 2-3 months

The immediate objective is not live trading. The immediate objective is:

- reliable data pipelines
- clean research datasets
- factor validation
- backtesting
- model-ready feature tables

## Current Status

What already exists:

- historical and incremental news collection
- stock daily price collection
- company-match cleaning pipeline for news
- cleaned matched-news collection:
  - `news_articles_company_matched_v1`
- daily feature build pipeline
- cleaned feature collection:
  - `daily_symbol_features_company_matched_v1`
- first-pass single-factor backtest script

What is still missing:

- benchmark-relative labels and evaluation
- stronger research-quality filtering layer
- richer factor library
- grouped / long-short backtests
- model training pipeline
- portfolio construction layer
- production signal generation layer

## System Scope

The system should support:

- company/news relevance filtering
- daily feature generation
- mid-horizon return prediction
- factor and model research
- portfolio simulation
- scheduled data refresh
- production deployment later

## Required Data

### 1. News Data
Already partially done.

Needed:

- raw news store
- company-matched clean news store
- source metadata
- title
- body/content
- data quality tags
- company relevance result

Current collections:

- `news_articles`
- `news_articles_company_matched_v1`

### 2. Price Data
Needed:

- daily OHLCV
- adjusted close if possible
- volume
- trading date alignment

Current collection:

- `stock_prices_history`

### 3. Benchmark and Market Data
Still needed / should be added:

- SPY / QQQ / sector ETF daily prices
- benchmark forward returns
- optional factor benchmarks:
  - momentum
  - size
  - quality
  - volatility

### 4. Fundamental / Event Data
Recommended next:

- earnings dates
- EPS / revenue / guidance
- valuation metrics
- analyst estimate revision data if available
- corporate actions

### 5. Metadata
Needed:

- sector / industry
- market cap bucket
- symbol universe definition
- active/inactive date ranges

## Core Collections / Tables

### Raw Layer

- `news_articles`
- `stock_prices_history`

### Clean Layer

- `news_articles_company_matched_v1`

### Feature Layer

- `daily_symbol_features_company_matched_v1`

### Planned Next Collections

- `daily_symbol_features_research_v1`
  - optional refined feature table after additional research-quality filtering
- `backtest_results`
  - optional persistent experiment tracking
- `benchmark_prices`
  - benchmark ETF / index data
- `earnings_events`
  - earnings calendar / event layer

## Current Feature Set

Already generated in daily features:

- `article_count`
- `full_count`
- `title_only_count`
- `url_only_count`
- `full_ratio`
- `title_only_ratio`
- `avg_content_length`
- `max_content_length`
- `unique_url_count`
- `unique_source_count`
- `unique_platform_count`
- `extraction_failed_count`
- `timeout_fallback_count`
- `news_count_3d`
- `news_count_5d`
- `news_count_20d`
- `full_count_5d`
- `avg_full_ratio_5d`
- `news_burst_20d`
- `trade_date`
- `close`
- `future_ret_5d`
- `future_ret_20d`
- `future_ret_60d`

## Prediction Targets

The system should support multiple target definitions.

### Absolute Return Targets

- `future_ret_5d`
- `future_ret_20d`
- `future_ret_60d`

### Direction Targets

- `future_ret_5d > 0`
- `future_ret_20d > 0`
- `future_ret_60d > 0`

### Recommended Future Targets

- benchmark-relative return:
  - stock return minus SPY / QQQ / sector ETF return
- ranking target:
  - cross-sectional rank by future return

For this project, ranking and excess-return targets are likely more useful than pure up/down classification.

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1. Data Integrity

Done or mostly done:

- collect raw news
- clean company relevance
- build daily features
- align with price labels

Still needed:

- benchmark alignment
- event/fundamental enrichment

### Phase 2. Factor Research

Current next step.

Need to run:

- top/bottom bucket tests
- long-short tests
- top 3 / top 5 / top 10 portfolio comparisons
- stability by year
- stability by horizon

First candidate factors:

- `full_ratio`
- `news_burst_20d`
- `article_count`
- `unique_source_count`
- `avg_content_length`
- `extraction_failed_count` as a reverse-quality feature

### Phase 3. Multi-Factor Research

After single-factor validation:

- combine quality factors
- combine quantity + quality + recency factors
- compare weighted score vs single-factor selection

### Phase 4. Modeling

Only after factor validation.

Recommended order:

1. linear / logistic models
2. tree models:
   - LightGBM
   - XGBoost
3. ranking models

Do not start with large text models for price prediction.

### Phase 5. Portfolio Construction

Need explicit rules for:

- rebalance frequency
- top N holdings
- equal weight vs score weight
- sector cap
- single-name cap
- turnover limit
- transaction cost assumptions

### Phase 6. Production

Later phase:

- daily incremental collection
- feature refresh
- model scoring
- signal generation
- order routing
- monitoring
- logging
- retry / failure handling

## Research Principles

### 1. Prefer simple baselines first

Always test:

- single factor
- grouped returns
- naive top-N strategy

before training larger models.

### 2. Use safe date windows

Backtests should use:

- `trade_date >= 2015-12-04`

because current price data coverage starts there.

### 3. Use clean collection by default

Research should prefer:

- `news_articles_company_matched_v1`
- `daily_symbol_features_company_matched_v1`

instead of raw collections.

### 4. Keep raw data immutable

Do not delete raw source collections.

Use separate clean / derived layers.

## Engineering Plan

## Stage 1. Immediate Next Tasks

1. Extend first-pass backtest
- top / bottom buckets
- long-short
- top 3 / top 5 / top 10

2. Add benchmark comparison
- SPY / QQQ / sector baseline

3. Build quality factor basket
- combine `full_ratio`, `unique_source_count`, `avg_content_length`, etc.

4. Validate by horizon
- 5d
- 20d
- 60d

## Stage 2. Near-Term Data Expansion

Status: substantially complete.

### Completed items

- benchmark/index price collection:
  - done (`SPY`, `QQQ` daily prices, `benchmark_ret_5d/20d/60d`, `excess_ret_*`)
- earnings event Layer 1 (timing only):
  - done
  - features: `days_to_earnings`, `days_since_earnings`,
    `is_earnings_window_5d`, `is_post_earnings_window_20d`
- earnings event Layer 2 (surprise + richer timing):
  - done
  - features: `eps_estimate_last`, `reported_eps_last`, `surprise_pct_last`,
    `is_positive_surprise`, `is_negative_surprise`,
    `days_to_earnings_bucket`, `days_since_earnings_bucket`,
    `is_pre_earnings_10d`, `is_post_earnings_5d`, `is_post_earnings_10d`,
    `is_post_positive_surprise_20d`, `is_post_negative_surprise_20d`
  - result: Ridge `60d` IC improved from `0.073` to `0.121` (+66%)
- sector mapping: basic version integrated

### Next: earnings event Layer 3

Build on Layer 2 with deeper surprise structure and interaction features.

1. surprise magnitude buckets
   - split `surprise_pct_last` into ordinal buckets:
     - large miss (< -5%), small miss (-5% to 0), small beat (0 to +5%),
       large beat (> +5%)
   - rationale: the market reacts non-linearly to surprise size

2. news quality × earnings interaction features
   - `full_ratio_x_post_positive`: `full_ratio` × `is_post_positive_surprise_20d`
   - `quality_score_x_post_negative`: `quality_score` × `is_post_negative_surprise_20d`
   - rationale: a positive surprise with high-quality news coverage is a
     stronger combined signal than either alone

3. earnings recency decay
   - `earnings_recency_weight`: exponential decay of `days_since_earnings`
     (weight = exp(-days_since / 20))
   - rationale: the post-earnings drift effect weakens as time passes

4. rerun backtest and model after Layer 3
   - compare against the Layer 2 baseline (Ridge `60d` IC = `0.121`)

### Most important next step: universe expansion

The current universe is 14 symbols.
This is the single biggest constraint on signal reliability.

Why this matters:

- at 14 symbols, one bad year (e.g. 2022, 2024) can make the IC negative
  due to sampling noise alone
- cross-sectional ranking needs depth: `top 3 / top 5` out of 14 is not
  robust; `top 5 / top 10` out of 50-100 is meaningfully more stable
- the current signals may be real but cannot be confirmed at this universe size

Target: expand to 50-100 symbols.

What is required:

1. extend `stock_universe` collection with new symbols
   - suggested scope: S&P 500 tech/growth names, or a defined sector basket
   - keep sector distribution balanced

2. collect historical news for new symbols
   - extend GDELT / news collector coverage
   - run `company_match_rescore` on new articles

3. collect price history for new symbols
   - extend `stock_prices_history`

4. rebuild feature table
   - `FEATURE_REBUILD_ALL=true` after data is ready

5. rerun all backtests and models on expanded universe
   - compare single-factor IC at 50-symbol vs 14-symbol universe
   - a good signal should survive and become more stable

## Stage 3. Modeling

Status: first-pass baselines done.

Current baseline results (14-symbol universe):

- `Ridge` `60d` Rank IC: `0.121` / Top 5 excess return: `+6.58%`
- `HistGB` `60d` Rank IC: `0.118` / Top 5 excess return: `+6.32%`

Known issue: year-by-year variance is high.

- strong years: 2020 (IC = 0.35), 2023 (IC = 0.19), 2025 (IC = 0.24)
- weak years: 2022 (IC = -0.06), 2024 (IC = -0.04)
- likely cause: macro regime shifts (2022: rate hikes + war; 2024: election
  + rate pivot) break the news-quality thesis temporarily

Next modeling steps (do only after universe expansion):

1. year stability analysis
   - run `--group-by-year` on factor backtest with full feature set
   - identify which features drive the 2022/2024 failures
   - test whether regime-aware features (e.g. VIX level, market vol) help

2. simple Ridge + HistGB ensemble
   - average predictions from both models
   - rationale: the two models now have comparable IC and different error
     patterns; blending should reduce variance

3. sector-relative feature normalization
   - normalize `full_ratio`, `quality_score` within sector on each day
   - reduces bias from sectors that structurally attract more/less news

4. ranking model
   - convert to a pairwise ranking objective (LambdaRank or similar)
   - more directly aligned with the top-N portfolio construction goal

## Stage 4. Production Readiness

1. schedule feature build from clean news
2. track model versions
3. persist experiment results
4. build daily signal job
5. add monitoring

- `research/build_interaction_features.py`
  - earnings × news quality interaction features (Layer 3)
- `research/expand_universe.py`
  - helper to onboard new symbols into stock_universe and trigger collection

## Recommended Success Criteria

The project should be considered healthy if:

- clean company-matched news can be built reproducibly
- feature table refresh is stable
- at least one factor shows persistent positive excess return
- results are stable across multiple years
- simple baselines are competitive before modeling

## Current Practical Recommendation

Do next (in priority order):

1. **universe expansion** — most important; expand to 50+ symbols before
   further feature or model work; current 14-symbol results cannot be
   reliably confirmed
2. **year stability analysis** — run group-by-year on current full feature
   set; understand what drives 2022/2024 IC failures before adding more
   features
3. **earnings Layer 3** — surprise magnitude buckets and news × earnings
   interaction features; do after stability analysis confirms value

Do not do next:

- live trading automation
- complex deep learning or LLM-based modeling
- adding more data sources before validating signals on expanded universe
- switching local SLM model without accuracy benchmarking

## Notes

The clean matched-news dataset is research-usable at the current scale.

The two-layer earnings feature set has produced a meaningful model
improvement (Ridge `60d` IC: `0.073` → `0.121`).

The signal looks real but the universe is too small to confirm it with
confidence. Universe expansion is the gating step before any further
research investment makes sense.
